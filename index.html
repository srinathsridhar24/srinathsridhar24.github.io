		<h2>The Heaviside Condition.</h2>

		<p class="FirstPara"> It was February 3rd, 2020. Professor Sharma was taking System Design that semester and we had just moved to studying transmission lines. As usual, Prof. Sharma entered the class a couple of minutes early, set up the projector and started the class at 10:30AM on the dot. About half an hour into the class, he said something that took us by surprise. He said he will be digressing off topic and will be talking about a forgotten scientist. This was strange. Professor Sharma valued his class hours more than gold and is not known to indulge in discussions other than the subject. So this was probably important to him. While the other students in my class recorded his lectures to refer later, I never did. I had a feeling this was going to be something special and hence had recorded the talk. I wasn't wrong. </p>

		<p> Oliver Heaviside was no ordinary scientist. If one needed a PhD to be called a scientist, Heaviside shouldn't even be called one. He dropped out of school when he was 16 and never had any formal college education. However his accomplishments are no less significant than those by Albert Einstein. While school teaches about innovations of other great scientists like Newton, Einstein, Edison and Madame Curie, most of us have hardly heard Heaviside's name. Nikola Tesla, one of the most prolific minds of the nineteeth century, gained his due recognition posthumously. Sadly, people are yet to see what Heaviside contributed to the field of Electricity and Magnetism.  I was pursuing my Masters in Electrical Engineering when I first heard of Heaviside, thanks to this talk by Prof. Sharma. I am not particularly proud of this fact. This is precisely why I chose to write about him today. In hindsight, this is precisely why Prof. Sharma chose to talk about him that day. Today there are many articles on Heaviside's life and achievements. But I am afraid he is far less celebrated than he should be.</p>


		<p> So what among his numerous achievements have we missed? All. Let me start with something that most of us know. Most of the science students must have studied about Impedance, Admittance, Conductance, Inductance, Permeabitlity , Permittance during high school. But how many of them know that it was Oliver Heaviside who coined these terms? These terms were picked from the once popular tech magazine <i> The Electrician</i> to which Heaviside contributed 2-3 articles per month. All engineers learn vector calculus during the initial years of their study. It is the most elegant way to solve complex differential equations. Again, it was Oliver Heaviside who independently developed vector calculus. The famous Maxwell's equations that form the foundation of electromagnetism were not as elegant as they are today. It comprised of 20 equations with 20 unknowns. It was Heaviside that rewrote these succintly into the four equations that we know today as Maxwell's equations. How unfair is it to not give Heaviside any credit to this? Not only that, the unit step function that electrical engineers so often use to do circuit analysis was invented by Heaviside.</p>
 
		<p> Heaviside's most important contribution, however, is the development of transmission line theory. After dropping out of school, Heaviside worked at one of his uncle's telegraph companies. This is when he spent most of his time developing theories on design of Transmission Lines. His uncle is Sir Charles Wheatsone, after whom is named the famous Wheatstone Bridge arrangement. As a matter of fact, it was Heaviside who published an article on 'The Best Arrangement of Wheatstone's Bridge for measuring a Given Resistance with a Given Galvanometer and Battery'. Today in 2021, students in schools across the world still use this method to find the unknown resistance in a wheatstone bridge. Coming back to his contributions to transmission lines, Heaviside showed mathematically that inductance in a transmission line actually helps in diminshing attenuation and distortion. He went on to prove that if the inductance were great enough and the insulation resistance not too high, the circuit would be distortionless in that currents of all frequencies would have equal speeds of propagation. This would go on to be called The Heaviside Condition - probably the only time a science student would across this name. However, this theory of Heaviside that adding inductance to the transmission lines would help in better transmission was strongly crtiticized and ultimately dismissed by the then powerful Post Office. The Post Office actually went on to pull out Heaviside's article from <i> The Electrician </i> magazine because of which this theory lay in public domain for a long time. Later, Heaviside' theory was vindicated by AT&T and offered him money in exchange for his rights. However, Heaviside refused the offer, declining to accept any money unless the company were to give him full recognition. Heaviside would go on to remain poor for the rest of his life. </p> 

		<p> Having been ignored by the scientific community for years, Heaviside spent most of his later years locked up in his house and avoiding any social contact. Heaviside's personal life right from his childhood had many disturbing events which I would save for you to read.  After a serious fall from the top of a ladder in late 1924, he refused a doctor and insisted on recovering on his own.  In January 1925, friends called police when they were unable to get any answer at his house.  He was found unconscious in his bedroom and taken by ambulance to a nursing home in Torquay (the only time in his life that he had ever been in a motor vehicle). Oliver Heaviside died on February 3 and was buried next to his parents. The fact that Prof. Sharma chose to speak about Oliver Heaviside on February 3 cannot be a mere coincidence. </p>

		<h2>Sharma and the Swivel.</h2>

		<p class="FirstPara"> I came to know that it is Hitman's birthday today. I thought I will repost an article that I wrote on Sharma a while ago. Also because this blog has been inactive for a while now.</p>

		<p> Everyone remembers what happened when India played England in the 2007 T20 World Cup. Every cricket fan was left gaping as Yuvraj’s carnage decimated England, Stuart Broad in particular. But this article isn’t about Yuvraj. The day also marked the T20 debut of a fine young batsman. Though he didn’t get a chance to bat on his debut, the world did take note of his name when he made a crucial 50* against South Africa helping India post a fighting total. The 2007 T20 world cup final has always been about Gambhir’s gritty 75, Irfan Pathan’s 3-for, Dhoni’s strategy, Joginder’s final over, Misbah’s misfortune and what not, but not many remember the valuable 30* that this man played. Yes, Rohit Sharma.</p>

		<img src="rohit.jpg" id="rohit">

		<p> For a long time since then, people talked about his “talent”. There was something about Rohit’s batting that the cricket audience admired. Was it the timing? Was it the flair? Or was it the power? Every shot of his had a perfect blend of all the three, a talent not many possessed. </p> 

		<p>After a successful outing in the inaugural T20 world cup, Rohit became a fairly known name and was eventually made a regular member in the Indian ODI squad. It was only in the 2008 CB series in Australia, that the world got to know what the cricket gurus meant when they said “ This lad has immense talent.” The first final of the series against Australia saw a magnificent century from the Little Master, but also a brilliant 66 by Sharma coming in at no.5. Sachin, the MoM in the first final, talked mostly about Rohit during the post match presentation. When the God himself says this man is special, it has got to be true. </p>

		<p>After the CB series, Rohit had a forgettable season. A string of low scores, and his place in the eleven was uncertain. The rise of other middle order batsmen like Raina and Yusuf Pathan didn’t help his cause. Rohit Sharma was eventually denied a place in the 2011 World Cup squad. To this day, Sharma describes the 2011 world cup snub as the darkest phase in his career.</p>

		<h4>The Resurgence of Rohit</h4>

		<p> Post 2011 world cup, Sehwag and Gambhir’s forms dipped. India found a champion opener in Shikhar Dhawan, who was already well known in the domestic circuit. With Sachin retiring from the ODI format in 2012, India desperately needed another opener. That is when MS scripted this movie called “Rohit Sharma –the Opener” that would go on to become a blockbuster. Players like Sehwag, Yuvraj, Zaheer and Harbhajan always attributed their success to Saurav’s faith in them. For Rohit, it has got to be the genius that is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Rohit was asked to open the batting alongside Dhawan in the 2013 Champions Trophy in England and the rest, we all know is history. The Rohit- Dhawan opening duo is now one of the most successful opening pairs in ODI history, only behind legendary opening pairs like Sachin- Saurav, Hayden-Gilchrist and Greenidge- Haynes. It is only a matter of time before they top this list.</p> 

		<h4>The Daddy of Daddy- Hundreds</h4>

		<p> When the little master created history in February, 2010 in Gwalior by becoming the first man on the planet to score an ODI double century, it seemed to be a never-to-be-achieved-again feat. Although many did manage to score double centuries later, it was only Sharma who did it not once, not twice but thrice. It will not be surprising if he goes on to make few more. If there is any batsman whose fans expect him to score a double century every time he scores a 100, it is only Rohit Sharma. There is always this “want for more” when Rohit is batting. That is the reputation he has created for himself. Rohit now has eight 150 plus scores in ODIs- the most by any batsman.</p> 

		<h4>The New Sixer King ?</h4>

		<p> Who comes to our mind when we hear the word “Sixer King”? Yuvraj ? Dhoni? Sehwag ? Or for some old fashioned people like me, it is Saurav. By the way, I am a big admirer of Ganguly’s dancing down the track sixes. They are just majestic. But now ladies and gentlemen, it is time we pass on the title of Sixer-King to Sharma. To quote Kohli “He seems to have those extra 1.5 seconds.” It is the nonchalance with which Sharma hits those sixes, that leaves us awestruck. Unlike Dhoni, he doesn’t seem to invest enormous power into his shots, but the exquisite timing sends the ball equally long. He has made the “swivel and pull” his own. When Sharma swivels, you better get a new ball. Sharma is only behind Chris Gayle and Shahid Afridi in terms of most number of sixes in international matches.</p> 

		<h4>Sharma- legend in the making? – No, already one !</h4>

		<p> Sharma’s limited over stats are nothing short of iconic. Having nearly 9000 ODI runs and 28 ODI hundreds, Sharma is already a legend in limited-overs cricket. He can be extremely proud of the way he has sculpted his career. His story can be an inspiration to anyone facing an initial failure. Rohit is now fondly called Hit-Man by his fans. But there was a time when the same people called him names for his failure to stay at the crease for a long time. Sharma did have his share of lows in his career like any other cricket great. But it is the way in which he has risen since then that makes him a legend for me. Like any other Rohit fan, I want more. Keep swivelling, Sharma!.</p>

		<h2>Advice? No, thanks!</h2>

		<p class="FirstPara">Most of us hate advice, don't we? I wonder why. The one thing that comes to the top of my mind is, we don't like to be told what is to be done. Is that it? Is that the only reason?  I realized there is something else that bugs me. This is more about the person that is dishing me out the advice, that was unwarranted in the first place. More often than not, I wander off thinking what is it that made this person believe he is special and worthy of dishing out advice.   </p>


		<p> At the risk of sounding arrogant, I must confess I don't like listening to advice from people that haven't done anything special. Of course, there are exceptions. I listen to people that are very close to me because I know for sure that they have my best interest in their minds. But an average Joe telling me what to do, and how and where I can improve - I have little tolerance to this. Of course I understand that this intolerance is justified only when the advice is unsolicited. If I go and ask someone their opinion and I hear something that I don't like, I cannot argue. Come on, I asked for it. </p>

		<p> This aversion to conceitedness disguised as compassion probably started when I was in primary school. There was this guy who was one year senior to my brother. I remember my brother was in fifth standard (I am not going to say fifth <i>grade</i> like an American. For me, it is fifth *standard*) and this guy was  in sixth. So one day he comes up to my brother and says "Fifth standard is easy and all. You will be in sixth standard next year and you will see it is quite tough." Not knowing much about this guy, my brother thought what he said is possibly true. So next year, my brother was in sixth and our guy was in seventh. He comes up to my brother again and says "You know what, sixth standard is nothing. Come to seventh and you will know what struggle is." This time my brother took it with a pinch of salt and mostly ignored all that he said. Next year, my brother goes to seventh and guess who comes again to scare him. Surprise, surprise, it is our average Joe. </p> 

		<p> And why do I call him an average Joe? See, being in sixth or seventh standard is quite ordinary. There is nothing special about that , right? Now as I grew up, I find there are many of these average Joes who think they are doing something special while all they are doing is just being average. One of the professors in my department who worked in various companies keeps talking about how difficult it is working in the industry. He keeps saying things such as "You should have excellent knowledge in this subject to get recruited", "You should have excellent communication skills and presentation skills to survive in the workplace" and this and that.  And the list of skills that he thinks we should have before going for work is endless. Seriously? Is working in a company that difficult? India has a population of 1.3 billion. Majority of the households will have atleast one person working in a company. So you get the scale, right? Now do you think all of them have all these skills that you mentioned. Of course not. While the professor thinks he is trying to motivate the students by saying such things, all he achieved is lie in front of them and  make them feel insecure. I can see parallels between this professor and the average Joe my brother encountered in school. There is a very simple mantra that I live by. If there are many people doing something, that means doing that something is not difficult. Doing that something does not need enormous amount of <i>talent</i> or <i>skill</i>. And finally, doing that something does not make you "special".</p>

		<p> This mantra can be applied to many other things as well. When we learn driving, most of us encounter this one guy who comes up and says "Oh you are learning to drive now? You need to have good reflexes, hand-eye coordination and great concentration." Again seriously brother? You think the drivers of the thousands of cars out there have excellent "hand-eye coordination"? Again , what might sound like advice is actually intimidation by a conceited bugger who thinks driving a car is a special skill.</p>

		<p> My brother once said "the easiest thing to do to be comfortable in life is study and get a job. If you have done this, that itself means you have chosen the easiest of options and are far from anything special. Because anyone can do that." I was mighty impressed by these words. I'll try to bring some perspective here:
			<ul>
				<li>I finished high school, can I think I am special? - No. There are millions who have done that. That's easy to agree, right?	</li>
				<li>I have an Engineering degree. Hey, Engineering is tough and that must mean I have done something special, right? - Huh, you cannot be more wrong. The rate at which this country is churning out engineers, soon you are likely to be looked down upon for choosing Engineering. Special? Pfft!</li>
				<li>I did an MBA. So all white collar and all. Isn't that an achievement? No, no and no. Nearly 200,000 students in the US are awarded MBA degrees every year since 2010. Imagine the plight in India.</li>
				<li> I have a PhD. That takes years of patience, persistence and dedication. For the love of God, now can I think I have done something worthy enough to gloat? - I wish I could say Yes. I'll just put this picture here to speak a thousand words.
					<img src="phd.jpg" id="phd">
					Further, in India alone, nearly 30,000 students are awarded PhDs every year. So when you calculate the number of PhDs this country has, do you think you can count yourself as someone special? You decide.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p> I know I have gone on a rant here. I don't know what tipped me off. Yeah, but my point is, before you look down and see so many people who haven't achieved what you have, look up and see all those people who have achieved far better things. That should make your ego null and void. And yeah, about the advice, everyone to whom you are dishing out advice is better than you at something. Would you like it if he starts giving you unsolicited advice about that? Something to ponder about.</p> 

		<p> Wait, am I doing those things that I asked you not to? Unsolicited advice? Umm ,probably not. I am not pointing fingers at anyone here. And blog posts are allowed, aren' they?</p>

		<h2>In your music is my heaven.</h2>

		<p class="FirstPara">Goosebumps. What a strange word. I had to google this word to find its etymology. Wikipedia says goose bumps refer to the bumps that develop at the base of body hairs when you are experiencing feelings of fear, sexual arousal or euphoria. Wonder what I am experiencing now. Apparently these bumps resemble the bumps that appear on the skin of a goose when you pluck its feathers. Jeez, Why would anyone do that! Anyway, now that the etymology is clear, I wanted to find why this weird phenomenon keeps occuring to me everytime I watch this video.</p>

		<iframe width="460" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ss-kLGW2pHQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p> There is an ensemble of musicians and singers on the dais and they are singing "Vande Mataram"- the original one written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. There is a beautiful demonstration of Bharata Natyam going on parallely and the dancer is <i>killing it</i> with her expressions. There is something about this version of the song that brings a tear or two out of our eyes . Is it the lyrics or the composition ? Or does it remind us of the  struggles of our independence movement? Whatever it is, the song succeeds in helping us transcend to a different timeline, a happy timeline. We let tears of joy as if we had just achieved something for which we were fighting since a long time. This song has been hugely successful in keeping that emotion alive. You can see a girl towards the far right of the ensemble struggling to contain this emotion. She wipes off her happy tears not minding that she is disturbing her mascara. She doesn't seem to care that her eyes are smudgy; she soon wears a beautiful smile.</p>

		<p> Meanwhile a lady emerges from the group with a soulful aalaap. She leads another person who picks it up from where she left and together they hold the audience rapt for about thirty seconds with their pitch perfect aalaaps. The mood lightens all of a sudden and the audience give a big cheer. Little do they know at this point that this is only the beginning of something special. The music changes gears and seamlessly blends into another song. Another "Vande Mataram". </p> 

		<p> As unfortunate as it might sound, when a person born in the 90s or in the early 2000s hears the words "Vande Mataram", the first picture that comes to his mind is neither of the freedom struggle nor of the great Bankim Chandra Chattapodhyay. It is probably of a then long haired music composer called A.R.Rahman. But he or she cannot be blamed. In the year 1997, A.R.Rahman revolutionized this song altogether. He made a whole generation of people sit up and take note of this absolute masterpice he had created. He made patriotism cool again. Kids sang and danced to this Vande Mataram in school functions. While the lyrics of this new version are completely different vis-a-vis the original version, they both served one common purpose: to instill a sense of pride in every Indian about being an Indian. </p>

		<p>Going back to the performance, the singers nonchalantly sing the high notes and the audience are cheering more than ever. About midway through the performance, the music dies gradually to a low decibel. Just as the audience are given a break from all the cheering, the singers continue the song - but in Tamil. This is so intelligent. They could not have picked a better paragraph from the Tamil version. They sing "<i>Thaaye un peyar sollumbodhae , idhayathalil minnalai paayumae; Inivarum kaalam ilaignanin kaalam , un kadal mellisai paadumae."</i> As they are  building the crescendo, there is a huge uproar all of a sudden from the audience. Even the singers are puzzled and they turn back to see what is it that has caused the audience to go into a frenzy. Enters ARR.</p>

		<p> Wearing a glittery purple kurta and a mild smile, he walks to the front of the stage with a microphone in his hand. The girls standing to the left of the dais adjacent to ARR are visibly star-struck and we can see that they are elated just standing next to the legend himself. A couple of girls slightly raise their hands gesturing ARR to occupy the centre of the stage. Not to anyone's surprise, he politely refuses indicating it is these singers who are the stars of the evening. I don't think all this is planned or scripted, but just after ARR arrives on the stage, they sing "<i>Tu hi zindagi hai. Tu hi meri mohabbat hai. Tere hi pairon mein jannat hai. Tu hi dil. Tu Jaan.</i>" While the lyricist of this song, Mehboob, had penned these lines keeping Mother India in his mind, you can see that these young boys and girls are looking at ARR while singing these lines. Talk about timing! For the singers there, his songs probably were their "<i>zindagi</i>." That must have been a magical night at the Berklee College of Music and the singers sure have a story to tell their grandchildren.</p> 

		<p> As I write this, there it is again- the Goosebumps. So euphoria it is!</p>
