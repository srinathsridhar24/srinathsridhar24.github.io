	<h2>Advice? No, thanks!</h2>

	<p class="FirstPara">Most of us hate advice, don't we? I wonder why. The one thing that comes to the top of my mind is, we don't like to be told what is to be done. Is that it? Is that the only reason?  I realized there is something else that bugs me. This is more about the person that is dishing me out the advice, that was unwarranted in the first place. More often than not, I wander off thinking what is it that made this person believe he is special and worthy of dishing out advice.   </p>


<p> At the risk of sounding arrogant, I must confess I don't like listening to advice from people that haven't done anything special. Of course, there are exceptions. I listen to people that are very close to me because I know for sure that they have my best interest in their minds. But an average Joe telling me what to do, and how and where I can improve - I have little tolerance to this. Of course I understand that this intolerance is justified only when the advice is unsolicited. If I go and ask someone their opinion and I hear something that I don't like, I cannot argue. Come on, I asked for it. </p>

<p> This aversion to conceitedness disguised as compassion probably started when I was in primary school. There was this guy who was one year senior to my brother. I remember my brother was in fifth standard (I am not going to say fifth <i>grade</i> like an American. For me, it is fifth *standard*) and this guy was  in sixth. So one day he comes up to my brother and says "Fifth standard is easy and all. You will be in sixth standard next year and you will see it is quite tough." Not knowing much about this guy, my brother thought what he said is possibly true. So next year, my brother was in sixth and our guy was in seventh. He comes up to my brother again and says "You know what, sixth standard is nothing. Come to seventh and you will know what struggle is." This time my brother took it with a pinch of salt and mostly ignored all that he said. Next year, my brother goes to seventh and guess who comes again to scare him. Surprise, surprise, it is our average Joe. </p> 

<p> And why do I call him an average Joe? See, being in sixth or seventh standard is quite ordinary. There is nothing special about that , right? Now as I grew up, I find there are many of these average Joes who think they are doing something special while all they are doing is just being average. One of the professors in my department who worked in various companies keeps talking about how difficult it is working in the industry. He keeps saying things such as "You should have excellent knowledge in this subject to get recruited", "You should have excellent communication skills and presentation skills to survive in the workplace" and this and that.  And the list of skills that he thinks we should have before going for work is endless. Seriously? Is working in a company that difficult? India has a population of 1.3 billion. Majority of the households will have atleast one person working in a company. So you get the scale, right? Now do you think all of them have all these skills that you mentioned. Of course not. While the professor thinks he is trying to motivate the students by saying such things, all he achieved is lie in front of them and  make them feel insecure. I can see parallels between this professor and the average Joe my brother encountered in school. There is a very simple mantra that I live by. If there are many people doing something, that means doing that something is not difficult. Doing that something does not need enormous amount of <i>talent</i> or <i>skill</i>. And finally, doing that something does not make you "special".</p>

<p> This mantra can be applied to many other things as well. When we learn driving, most of us encounter this one guy who comes up and says "Oh you are learning to drive now? You need to have good reflexes, hand-eye coordination and great concentration." Again seriously brother? You think the drivers of the thousands of cars out there have excellent "hand-eye coordination"? Again , what might sound like advice is actually intimidation by a conceited bugger who thinks driving a car is a special skill.</p>

<p> My brother once said "the easiest thing to do to be comfortable in life is study and get a job. If you have done this, that itself means you have chosen the easiest of options and are far from anything special. Because anyone can do that." I was mighty impressed by these words. I'll try to bring some perspective here:
<ul>
	<li>I finished high school, can I think I am special? - No. There are millions who have done that. That's easy to agree, right?	</li>
	<li>I have an Engineering degree. Hey, Engineering is tough and that must mean I have done something special, right? - Huh, you cannot be more wrong. The rate at which this country is churning out engineers, soon you are likely to be looked down upon for choosing Engineering. Special? Pfft!</li>
	<li>I did an MBA. So all white collar and all. Isn't that an achievement? No, no and no. Nearly 200,000 students in the US are awarded MBA degrees every year since 2010. Imagine the plight in India.</li>
	<li> I have a PhD. That takes years of patience, persistence and dedication. For the love of God, now can I think I have done something worthy enough to gloat? - I wish I could say Yes. I'll just put this picture here to speak a thousand words.
		<img src="phd.jpg" id="phd">
		Further, in India alone, nearly 30,000 students are awarded PhDs every year. So when you calculate the number of PhDs this country has, do you think you can count yourself as someone special? You decide.
	</li>
</ul>
 </p>

<p> I know I have gone on a rant here. I don't know what tipped me off. Yeah, but my point is, before you look down and see so many people who haven't achieved what you have, look up and see all those people who have achieved far better things. That should make your ego null and void. And yeah, about the advice, everyone to whom you are dishing out advice is better than you at something. Would you like it if he starts giving you unsolicited advice about that? Something to ponder about.</p> 

<p> Wait, am I doing those things that I asked you not to? Unsolicited advice? Umm ,probably not. I am not pointing fingers at anyone here. And blog posts are allowed, aren' they?</p>

	<h2>In your music is my heaven.</h2>

	<p class="FirstPara">Goosebumps. What a strange word. I had to google this word to find its etymology. Wikipedia says goose bumps refer to the bumps that develop at the base of body hairs when you are experiencing feelings of fear, sexual arousal or euphoria. Wonder what I am experiencing now. Apparently these bumps resemble the bumps that appear on the skin of a goose when you pluck its feathers. Jeez, Why would anyone do that! Anyway, now that the etymology is clear, I wanted to find why this weird phenomenon keeps occuring to me everytime I watch this video.</p>

	<iframe width="460" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ss-kLGW2pHQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> There is an ensemble of musicians and singers on the dais and they are singing "Vande Mataram"- the original one written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. There is a beautiful demonstration of Bharata Natyam going on parallely and the dancer is <i>killing it</i> with her expressions. There is something about this version of the song that brings a tear or two out of our eyes . Is it the lyrics or the composition ? Or does it remind us of the  struggles of our independence movement? Whatever it is, the song succeeds in helping us transcend to a different timeline, a happy timeline. We let tears of joy as if we had just achieved something for which we were fighting since a long time. This song has been hugely successful in keeping that emotion alive. You can see a girl towards the far right of the ensemble struggling to contain this emotion. She wipes off her happy tears not minding that she is disturbing her mascara. She doesn't seem to care that her eyes are smudgy; she soon wears a beautiful smile.</p>

<p> Meanwhile a lady emerges from the group with a soulful aalaap. She leads another person who picks it up from where she left and together they hold the audience rapt for about thirty seconds with their pitch perfect aalaaps. The mood lightens all of a sudden and the audience give a big cheer. Little do they know at this point that this is only the beginning of something special. The music changes gears and seamlessly blends into another song. Another "Vande Mataram". </p> 

<p> As unfortunate as it might sound, when a person born in the 90s or in the early 2000s hears the words "Vande Mataram", the first picture that comes to his mind is neither of the freedom struggle nor of the great Bankim Chandra Chattapodhyay. It is probably of a then long haired music composer called A.R.Rahman. But he or she cannot be blamed. In the year 1997, A.R.Rahman revolutionized this song altogether. He made a whole generation of people sit up and take note of this absolute masterpice he had created. He made patriotism cool again. Kids sang and danced to this Vande Mataram in school functions. While the lyrics of this new version are completely different vis-a-vis the original version, they both served one common purpose: to instill a sense of pride in every Indian about being an Indian. </p>

<p>Going back to the performance, the singers nonchalantly sing the high notes and the audience are cheering more than ever. About midway through the performance, the music dies gradually to a low decibel. Just as the audience are given a break from all the cheering, the singers continue the song - but in Tamil. This is so intelligent. They could not have picked a better paragraph from the Tamil version. They sing "<i>Thaaye un peyar sollumbodhae , idhayathalil minnalai paayumae; Inivarum kaalam ilaignanin kaalam , un kadal mellisai paadumae."</i> As they are  building the crescendo, there is a huge uproar all of a sudden from the audience. Even the singers are puzzled and they turn back to see what is it that has caused the audience to go into a frenzy. Enters ARR.</p>

<p> Wearing a glittery purple kurta and a mild smile, he walks to the front of the stage with a microphone in his hand. The girls standing to the left of the dais adjacent to ARR are visibly star-struck and we can see that they are elated just standing next to the legend himself. A couple of girls slightly raise their hands gesturing ARR to occupy the centre of the stage. Not to anyone's surprise, he politely refuses indicating it is these singers who are the stars of the evening. I don't think all this is planned or scripted, but just after ARR arrives on the stage, they sing "<i>Tu hi zindagi hai. Tu hi meri mohabbat hai. Tere hi pairon mein jannat hai. Tu hi dil. Tu Jaan.</i>" While the lyricist of this song, Mehboob, had penned these lines keeping Mother India in his mind, you can see that these young boys and girls are looking at ARR while singing these lines. Talk about timing! For the singers there, his songs probably were their "<i>zindagi</i>." That must have been a magical night at the Berklee College of Music and the singers sure have a story to tell their grandchildren.</p> 

<p> As I write this, there it is again- the Goosebumps. So euphoria it is!</p>
