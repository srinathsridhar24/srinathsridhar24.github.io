	<h2>In your music is my heaven.</h2>

	<p class="FirstPara">Goosebumps. What a strange word. I had to google this word to find its etymology. Wikipedia says goose bumps refer to the bumps that develop at the base of body hairs when you are experiencing feelings of fear, sexual arousal or euphoria. Wonder what I am experiencing now. Apparently these bumps resemble the bumps that appear on the skin of a goose when you pluck its feathers. Jeez, Why would anyone do that! Anyway, now that the etymology is clear, I wanted to find why this weird phenomenon keeps occuring to me everytime I watch this video.</p>

<p> There is an ensemble of musicians and singers on the dias and they are singing "Vande Mataram"- the original one written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. There is a beautiful demonstration of Bharata Natyam going on parallely and the dancer is <i>killing it</i> with her expressions. There is something about this version of the song that brings a tear or two out of our eyes . Is it the lyrics or the composition ? Or does it remind us of the  struggles of our independence movement? Whatever it is, the song succeeds in helping us transcend to a different timeline, a happy timeline. We let tears of joy as if we had just achieved something for which we were fighting since a long time. This song has been hugely successful in keeping that emotion alive. You can see a girl towards the far right of the ensemble struggling to contain this emotion. She wipes off her happy tears not minding that she is disturbing her mascara. She doesn't seem to care that her eyes are smudgy; she soon wears a beautiful smile.</p>

<p> Meanwhile a lady emerges from the group with a soulful aalaap. She leads another person who picks it up from where she left and together they hold the audience rapt for about thirty seconds with their pitch perfect aalaaps. The mood lightens all of a sudden and the audience give a big cheer. Little do they know at this point that this is only the beginning of something special. The music changes gears and seamlessly blends into another song. Another "Vande Mataram". </p> 

<p> As unfortunate as it might sound, when a person born in the 90s or in the early 2000s hears the words "Vande Mataram", the first picture that comes to his mind is neither of the freedom struggle nor of the great Bankim Chandra Chattapodhyay. It is probably of a then long haired music composer called A.R.Rahman. But he or she cannot be blamed. In the year 1997, A.R.Rahman revolutionized this song altogether. He made a whole generation of people sit up and take note of this absolute masterpice he had created. He made patriotism cool again. Kids sang and danced to this Vande Mataram in school functions. While the lyrics of this new version are completely different vis-a-vis the original version, they both served one common purpose: to instill a sense of pride in every Indian about being an Indian. </p>

<p>Going back to the performance, the singers nonchalantly sing the high notes and the audience are cheering more than ever. About midway through the performance, the music dies gradually to a low decibel. Just as the audience are given a break from all the cheering, the singers continue the song - but in Tamil. This is so intelligent. They could not have picked a better paragraph from the Tamil version. They sing "<i>Thaaye un peyar sollumbodhae , idhayathalil minnalai paayumae; Inivarum kaalam ilaignanin kaalam , un kadal mellisai paadumae."</i> As they are  building the crescendo, there is a huge uproar all of a sudden from the audience. Even the singers are puzzled and they turn back to see what is it that has caused the audience to go into a frenzy. Enters ARR.</p>

<p> Wearing a glittery purple kurta and a mild smile, he walks to the front of the stage with a microphone in his hand. The girls standing to the left of the dias adjacent to ARR are visibly star-struck and we cane see that they are elated just standing next to the legend himself. A couple of girls slightly raise their hands gesturing ARR to occupy the centre of the stage. Not to anyone's surprise, he politely refuses indicating it is these singers who are the stars of the evening. I don't think all this is planned or scripted, but just after ARR arrives on the stage, they sing "<i>Tu hi zindagi hai. Tu hi meri mohabbat hai. Tere hi pairon mein jannat hai. Tu hi dil. Tu Jaan.</i>" While the legendary Gulzar had penned these lines keeping Mother India in his mind, you can see that these young boys and girls are looking at ARR while singing these lines. Talk about timing! For the singers there, his songs probably were their "<i>zindagi</i>." That was a magical night at Berklee College of Music and the singers sure have a story to tell to their grandchildren.</p> 

<p> As I write this, there it is again- the Goosebumps. So euphoria it is!</p>
